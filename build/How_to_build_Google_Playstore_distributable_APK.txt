How to build Android Playstore distributable APK


1. Make sure to not use #include, ie run

python combineFiles.py combine



2. Navigate to buildozer directory



3. Copy buildozer.spec to the buildozer directory



4. (if you are not Bernhard) Change

source.dir = /home/berny/Desktop/Shugou

to the directory where main.py lives



5. Update version number, needs to be higher than the previous (trailing zeros matter)

version = 1.0.0.0



6. Build unsigned apk

$sudo buildozer android release

an unsigned apk should appear in the 'bin' subdirectory



7. Check that the keystore file shugou.game.keystore is in the build directory. Ask Bernhard for password.

# every app can only have one keystore file. So you can't make a new one!
# !!!
# Do not use
$keytool –genkey –v –keystore shugou.game.keystore –alias shugou.game –keyalg RSA –validity 10000
# !!!



8. Sign the apk using jarsigner

$jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore shugou.game.keystore Shugou-1.0-release-unsigned.apk shugou.game

where you replace 'Shugou-1.0-release-unsigned.apk' with the location of the unsigned apk



9. Use zipalign to align the signed apk with the google play store standards

$./zipalign -v 4 before_alignment.apk after_alignment.apk

where you replace 'before_alignment.apk' and 'after_alignement.apk' with the corresponding path to the signed (input) and aligned (output) apk file.

zipalign is in your SDK tools folder. For me (Bernhard) this is '/home/berny/android-studio/sdk/tools'.



10. undo the combine using

python combineFiles.py clean
